Security Policy

The MCD (Maximizing Cost of Deception) framework is a defensive tool against weaponized misinformation. This is somewhat anti-Machevellian and anti-Establishment.

Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you find a way to "game" or deceive the MCD protocol itself, please do not post it publicly. We need to fix the "hole" before the oligarchs (western and estern) find it.

Please contact the architect to report any systemic flaws.

We follow a Responsible Disclosure model. We will acknowledge your findings, and fix the protocol before the "cat-strokers staring at a globe" can exploit it.
