## 📚 Glossary & FAQ

### What is "GRIME"?
**GRIME** stands for **"Ground Reality / Immutable Metric Enforcement."**
*(Or, philosophically: The "Sticky" Truth vs. The "Beige" Lie.)*

In the context of the **MCD Protocol**, "Grime" refers to the necessary friction of reality.
* **The Beige:** AI-generated content that is smooth, optimized for engagement, and often hallucinated (low entropy, high deception).
* **The Grime:** Human-verified reality that contains the "messiness" of truth (high entropy, verifiable provenance).
* **Grime-Level Checks:** Deep-dive validations performed by human nodes (OSINT, ethical review) that cannot be automated by a smooth algorithm.

### What is the "Space Breadstick"?
The **Space Breadstick** is the "Patient Zero" of the MCD paradigm. It refers to a 2024 incident where a viral image of a baguette was ingested by AI models and news aggregators as a scientific discovery (the comet 3I/ATLAS). It represents the failure of algorithms to distinguish between *Visual Engagement* and *Physical Reality*.

### What is the "Source URL"?
The **Source URL** is the immutable blockchain record or the canonical repository where the "Trust Score" of a piece of data originates. In this protocol, trust is not just a label; it is a verifiable chain of custody.

### Why "The Penguin Colony"?
A penguin colony survives through **Shared Warmth** (Collective Defense).
* **Current AI Model:** A lone predator optimized to eat (maximize engagement).
* **MCD Model:** A colony where individual nodes (validators) share the burden of verification. If one node identifies "Data Rot" (a predator), the entire colony shifts to protect the integrity of the dataset.
