Contributing to Maximizing Cost of Deception (MCD)

We are building a new paradigm for information integrity. Whether you are a Gen X cynic, a security researcher, or a non-technical observer, your input is vital to preventing the "Data Rot" of our global AI and LLM grid.

How to Help:

Case Studies: Help us document more "Space Breadstick"—instances where AI or the media ingested fake data as fact.

Trust Scoring Logic: Help us refine the math of the Trust Scoring Protocol. How do we weight a source?

Validation Nodes: We need niche experts to help define what "Grime-level" verification would look like in a specific fields (Astronomy, History, Medicine, etc.)

Note: We prioritize integrity over optimization. If you are here to "monetize" or "sell" trust, this is not the project for you.
