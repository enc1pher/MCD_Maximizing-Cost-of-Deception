My work on Information Integrity is not reactive; it is foundational. 

In 2019, during my talks at O'Reilly and GrrCON ('If Anything Can Be Real, Then Nothing Is Real'), I publicly predicted the rise of the 'Liar's Dividend' and proposed the theoretical necessity of 'Immutable Authentication Trails'—seven years before generative AI made them a global emergency. 

I correctly identified then that a centralized solution would be a privacy nightmare. I want to turn that 2019 prediction into the 2026 solution: the Decentralized MCD Protocol

Background & Prior Art: The core architecture of MCD is based on the concept of "Immutable Authentication Trails," which I first presented in October 2019.

The 2019 Prediction: We will need a service to cryptographically prove physical reality to defeat "emergent deepfakes."

The 2019 Warning: A single company owning this ledger creates a "Panopticon" vulnerability.

The 2026 Execution: The MCD Protocol solves this via Decentralized blockchain validation nodes (The "Penguin Colony"), removing the central point of failure I warned against seven years ago.

The concept of MCD (Maximizing Cost of Deception) was first publicly proposed by April C. Wright in October 2019 under the name "Immutable Authentication Trails."

In 2019, I made a Nic Cage-heavy-laden Prediction and identified that "If anything can be real, nothing is real" (The Liar's Dividend).

2019 Solution: Proposed "Immutable Authentication" to track reality.

The 2026 Evolution: MCD is the decentralized implementation of this 2019 architectural necessity.
